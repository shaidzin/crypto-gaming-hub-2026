# 🚨 GitHub Token Not Working

The GitHub token provided is not authenticating. Please:

## Option 1: Generate New Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Select scopes: **repo** (full control)
3. Generate and send me the new token

## Option 2: Manual Deploy
The site is fully ready. Just run:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/content-site
gh auth login
# (login with browser)
git push -u origin main
```

Then Vercel will auto-deploy!
